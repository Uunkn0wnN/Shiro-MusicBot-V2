## ✨Latest Updates

Our bot now works with Discord.js V13! We have been started working on [v5](https://github.com/SudhanPlayz/Discord-MusicBot/tree/v5) which will be out in some days/months with new features and much more are on the way.

## 🚧 Prerequisites

- [Node.js 14+](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- [discord.js@13.8.0](https://www.npmjs.com/package/discord.js/v/13.8.0)
- [Lavalink Server](https://darrennathanael.com/post/how-to-lavalink/?utm_source=github-sudhanplayz&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=sudhanplayz&utm_content=lavalink-prerequisites)

> NOTE: Lavalink is needed for music functionality. You need to have a working Lavalink server to make the bot work.
